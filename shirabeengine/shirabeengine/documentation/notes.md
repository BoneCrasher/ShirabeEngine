- PublicAPI should receive:
--- Input:  ResourceHandle or Descriptor
--- Output: ResourceHandle
- Internally, theres a static and a dynamic registry
- Static is serialized from "ResourceFile"
- Dynamic is everything done during execution
- ResourceHandle stores type -> Dynamic|Static 
- No fucking public wrapper classes anymore...
